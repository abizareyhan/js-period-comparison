# Period Comparison

This is implementation of [spatie/period](https://github.com/spatie/period) in JavaScript

This package adds support for comparing multiple dates with each other.
You can calculate the overlaps and differences between n-amount of periods,
as well as some more basic comparisons between two periods.

Periods can be constructed from any type of `moment.js` implementation, 

Periods are always immutable, there's never the worry about your input dates being changed. 

This package is still a work in progress.
